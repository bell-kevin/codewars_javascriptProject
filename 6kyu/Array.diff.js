Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
*/
function array_diff(a, b) {
  for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < b.length; j++) {
      if (a[i] == b[j]) {
        a.splice(i, 1)
        i--
      }
    }
  }
  return a
}
